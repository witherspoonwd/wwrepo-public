## About

This website began as a simple static HTML/CSS site and evolved into a dynamic platform with a MySQL database and PHP-based backend. During the setup process, I configured a LEMP stack, which allowed me to gain hands-on experience with web hosting basics. Although the code may not meet production standards, the website remains fully functional at a small scale and serves as a testament to my web development skills. It is important to note that this project is intended to showcase my abilities and is not intended to represent a professional-grade website.
