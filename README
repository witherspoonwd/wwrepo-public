## About

This website began as a static HTML/CSS site and evolved into a dynamic platform with a MySQL database and PHP-based backend. While the code may not meet production standards, it remains fully functional at a small scale. As an introduction to web development, the project has helped me develop essential skills and knowledge in the field. Please note that this project is intended to serve as a demonstration of my abilities and is not meant to represent a professional-grade website.
